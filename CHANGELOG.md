## [2026-01-09] - SEO & Positioning Optimization

### Changed
- **Page Title**: Updated from "Digital Twins for $1,500" to "Luxury Exterior 3D Property Tours | Real Estate Marketing | Altitude Vancouver"
- **Meta Description**: Repositioned from digital twin infrastructure to drone-captured 3D experiences for real estate marketing
- **Keywords**: Shifted focus from technical terms (digital twins, gaussian splatting) to real estate search terms (luxury real estate marketing, exterior property tours, 3D property marketing, new development marketing)
- **Hero Headline**: Changed from "Luxury Exterior 3D Experiences" to "Drone-Captured 3D Property Tours"
- **Hero Subtitle**: Added "Optimized for beauty, not blueprints" to differentiate from inspection/surveying tools
- **Open Graph/Twitter Tags**: Updated all social media meta tags to reflect new positioning and altitude.vision URL
- **Schema Markup**: Enhanced from generic "Service" to "ProfessionalService" with detailed offer catalog for three key customer profiles:
  - Luxury Residential Listings
  - New Development Pre-Sales
  - Commercial Real Estate

### Positioning Strategy
- Positioned as exterior-focused, marketing-grade alternative to Matterport (interior focus)
- Differentiated from inspection tools (Pix4D, DroneDeploy) by emphasizing beauty and storytelling over technical accuracy
- Target audience: Luxury real estate agents, commercial property developers, new development marketing teams
- Geographic focus: Vancouver, BC for local SEO

### Rationale
Based on real estate professional feedback: Focus on marketing/presentation piece rather than inspection/surveying. Target luxury exterior-first experiences designed for buyer exploration and storytelling, not technical renderings or blueprints.
